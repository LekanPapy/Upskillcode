A static class can be used as a convenient container for sets of 
methods that just operate on input parameters and do not have to 
get or set any internal instance fields. For example, 
in the .NET Framework Class Library, the static System.Math class 
contains methods that perform mathematical operations, 
without any requirement to store or retrieve data that is unique to 
a particular instance of the Math class.
